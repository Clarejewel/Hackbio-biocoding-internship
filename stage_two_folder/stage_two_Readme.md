**Instructions:
##Task Code 2.1:
#Microbiology

#Look at this dataset here- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/mcgc.tsv

#This is the description of the dataset . https://github.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/blob/main/Python/Dataset/mcgc_METADATA.txt [open in a new tab, not a file to be downloaded].

## Plot all the growth curves of OD600 vs Time for the different Strains with the following instructions

#For each strain, plot a growth curve of the the knock out (-) an knock in (+) strain overlaid on top of each other

#Using your function from last stage, determine the time to reach the carrying capacity for each strain/mutant

#Generate a scatter plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains

#Generate a box plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains

#Is there a statistical difference in the time it takes the knock out strains to reach their maximum carrying capacity compared to the knock in strains

#What do you see? Explain your observations as comments in your code.
